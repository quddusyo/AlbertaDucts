## Tips

#leave lots of whitespace (margin) on nav element as in chrome, as you scroll down, the mobile browser will add margin from top.
#to allow box-shadow on all form elements (including iOS safari mobile, as the mobile view on iOS phones tends to not show box-shadow) check commented syles on ContactContent.css file.
